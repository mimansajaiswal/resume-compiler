# INTERESTS / RESEARCH SUMMARY

# A brief paragraph summarizing your research interests or professional summary
interests_summary: |
  I am primarily interested in *LLM post-training and evaluation*, focusing on understanding why models fail or behave unexpectedly _(Failure Analysis)_, improving them through techniques such as RLHF/RLVR/RLAIF, DPO/GRPO, and reward modeling _(Post-Training)_, developing automated and synthetic evaluation systems to measure fine-grained capabilities and robustness _(Evaluation & Data Augmentation)_, integrating human knowledge and preferences into model development _(Human-in-the-Loop ML)_, and enhancing interpretability and deployment readiness _(Model Explainability & Deployment)_.
