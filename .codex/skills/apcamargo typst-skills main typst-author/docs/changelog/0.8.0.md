# 0.8.0

## Scripting

- Plugins (thanks to [@astrale-sharp](https://github.com/astrale-sharp) and [@arnaudgolfouse](https://github.com/arnaudgolfouse)) 
  - Typst can now load [plugins](/docs/reference/foundations/plugin/) that are compiled to WebAssembly
  - Anything that can be compiled to WebAssembly can thus be loaded as a plugin
  - These plugins are fully encapsulated (no access to file system or network)
  - Plugins can be shipped as part of [packages](/docs/reference/scripting/#packages)
  - Plugins work just the same in the web app
- Types are now first-class values **(Breaking change)** 
  - A [type](/docs/reference/foundations/type/) is now itself a value
  - Some types can be called like functions (those that have a constructor), e.g. [`int`](/docs/reference/foundations/int/) and [`str`](/docs/reference/foundations/str/)
  - Type checks are now of the form `type(10) == int` instead of the old `type(10) == "integer"`. [Compatibility](/docs/reference/foundations/type/#compatibility) with the old way will remain for a while to give package authors time to upgrade, but it will be removed at some point.
  - Methods are now syntax sugar for calling a function scoped to a type, meaning that `"hello".len()` is equivalent to `str.len("hello")`
- Added support for [`import`](/docs/reference/scripting/#modules) renaming with `as`
- Added a [`duration`](/docs/reference/foundations/duration/) type
- Added support for [CBOR](/docs/reference/data-loading/cbor/) encoding and decoding
- Added encoding and decoding functions from and to bytes for data formats: [`json.decode`](/docs/reference/data-loading/json/#definitions-decode), [`json.encode`](/docs/reference/data-loading/json/#definitions-encode), and similar functions for other formats
- Added [`array.intersperse`](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-intersperse) function
- Added [`str.rev`](/docs/reference/foundations/str/#definitions-rev) function
- Added `calc.tau` constant
- Made [bytes](/docs/reference/foundations/bytes/) joinable and addable
- Made [`array.zip`](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-zip) function variadic
- Fixed bug with [`eval`](/docs/reference/foundations/eval/) when the `mode` was set to `"math"`
- Fixed bug with [`ends-with`](/docs/reference/foundations/str/#definitions-ends-with) function on strings
- Fixed bug with destructuring in combination with break, continue, and return
- Fixed argument types of [hyperbolic functions](/docs/reference/foundations/calc/#functions-cosh), they don't allow angles anymore **(Breaking change)**
- Renamed some color methods: `rgba` becomes `to-rgba`, `cmyk` becomes `to-cmyk`, and `luma` becomes `to-luma` **(Breaking change)**

## Export

- Added SVG export (thanks to [@Enter-tainer](https://github.com/Enter-tainer))
- Fixed bugs with PDF font embedding
- Added support for page labels that reflect the [page numbering](/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-numbering) style in the PDF

## Text and Layout

- Added [`highlight`](/docs/reference/text/highlight/) function for highlighting text with a background color
- Added [`polygon.regular`](/docs/reference/visualize/polygon/#definitions-regular) function for drawing a regular polygon
- Added support for tabs in [`raw`](/docs/reference/text/raw/) elements alongside [`tab-width`](/docs/reference/text/raw/#parameters-tab-size) parameter
- The layout engine now tries to prevent "runts" (final lines consisting of just a single word)
- Added Finnish translations
- Added hyphenation support for Polish
- Improved handling of consecutive smart quotes of different kinds
- Fixed vertical alignments for [`number-align`](/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-number-align) argument on page function **(Breaking change)**
- Fixed weak pagebreaks after counter updates
- Fixed missing text in SVG when the text font is set to "New Computer Modern"
- Fixed translations for Chinese
- Fixed crash for empty text in show rule
- Fixed leading spaces when there's a linebreak after a number and a comma
- Fixed placement of floating elements in columns and other containers
- Fixed sizing of block containing just a single box

## Math

- Added support for [augmented matrices](/docs/reference/math/mat/#parameters-augment)
- Removed support for automatic matching of fences like `|` and `||` as there were too many false positives. You can use functions like [`abs`](/docs/reference/math/lr/#functions-abs) or [`norm`](/docs/reference/math/lr/#functions-norm) or an explicit [`lr`](/docs/reference/math/lr/#functions-lr) call instead. **(Breaking change)**
- Fixed spacing after number with decimal point in math
- Fixed bug with primes in subscript
- Fixed weak spacing
- Fixed crash when text within math contains a newline

## Tooling and Diagnostics

- Added hints when trying to call a function stored in a dictionary without extra parentheses
- Fixed hint when referencing an equation without numbering
- Added more details to some diagnostics (e.g. when SVG decoding fails)

## Command line interface

- Added `typst update` command for self-updating the CLI (thanks to [@jimvdl](https://github.com/jimvdl))
- Added download progress indicator for packages and updates
- Added `--format` argument to explicitly specify the output format
- The CLI now respects proxy configuration through environment variables and has a new `--cert` option for setting a custom CA certificate
- Fixed crash when field wasn't present and `--one` is passed to `typst query`

## Miscellaneous Improvements

- Added [Page Setup Guide](/docs/guides/page-setup/)
- Added [`figure.caption`](/docs/reference/model/figure/#definitions-caption) function that can be used for simpler figure customization (**Breaking change** because `it.caption` now renders the full caption with supplement in figure show rules and manual outlines)
- Moved `caption-pos` argument to `figure.caption` function and renamed it to `position` **(Breaking change)**
- Added [`separator`](/docs/reference/model/figure/#definitions-caption-separator) argument to `figure.caption` function
- Added support for combination of and/or and before/after [selectors](/docs/reference/foundations/selector/)
- Packages can now specify a [minimum compiler version](https://github.com/typst/packages#package-format) they require to work
- Fixed parser bug where method calls could be moved onto their own line for `#let` expressions in markup **(Breaking change)**
- Fixed bugs in sentence and title case conversion for bibliographies
- Fixed supplements for alphanumeric and author-title bibliography styles
- Fixed off-by-one error in APA bibliography style

## Development

- Made `Span` and `FileId` more type-safe so that all error conditions must be handled by `World` implementors
