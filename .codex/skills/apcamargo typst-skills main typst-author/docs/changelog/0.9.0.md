# 0.9.0

## Bibliography management

- New bibliography engine based on [CSL](https://citationstyles.org/) (Citation Style Language). Ships with about 100 commonly used citation styles and can load custom `.csl` files.
- Added new [`form`](/docs/reference/model/cite/#parameters-form) argument to the `cite` function to produce different forms of citations (e.g. for producing a citation suitable for inclusion in prose)
- The [`cite`](/docs/reference/model/cite/) function now takes only a single label/key instead of allowing multiple. Adjacent citations are merged and formatted according to the citation style's rules automatically. This works both with the reference syntax and explicit calls to the `cite` function. **(Breaking change)**
- The `cite` function now takes a [label](/docs/reference/foundations/label/) instead of a string **(Breaking change)**
- Added [`full`](/docs/reference/model/bibliography/#parameters-full) argument to bibliography function to print the full bibliography even if not all works were cited
- Bibliography entries can now contain Typst equations (wrapped in `$..$` just like in markup), this works both for `.yaml` and `.bib` bibliographies
- The hayagriva YAML format was improved. See its [changelog](https://github.com/typst/hayagriva/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for more details. **(Breaking change)**
- A few bugs with `.bib` file parsing were fixed
- Removed `brackets` argument of `cite` function in favor of `form`

## Performance

- Fixed a bug related to show rules in templates which would effectively disable incremental compilation in affected documents
- Micro-optimized code in several hot paths, which brings substantial performance gains, in particular in incremental compilations
- Improved incremental parsing, which affects the whole incremental compilation pipeline
- Added support for incremental parsing in the CLI
- Added support for incremental SVG encoding during PDF export, which greatly improves export performance for documents with many SVG

## Tooling and Diagnostics

- Improved autocompletion for variables that are in-scope
- Added autocompletion for package imports
- Added autocompletion for [labels](/docs/reference/foundations/label/)
- Added tooltip that shows which variables a function captures (when hovering over the equals sign or arrow of the function)
- Diagnostics are now deduplicated
- Improved diagnostics when trying to apply unary `+` or `-` to types that only support binary `+` and `-`
- Error messages now state which label or citation key isn't present in the document or its bibliography
- Fixed a bug where function argument parsing errors were shadowed by function execution errors (e.g. when trying to call [`array.sorted`](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-sorted) and passing the key function as a positional argument instead of a named one).

## Export

- Added support for configuring the document's creation [`date`](/docs/reference/model/document/#parameters-date). If the `date` is set to `auto` (the default), the PDF's creation date will be set to the current date and time.
- Added support for configuring document [`keywords`](/docs/reference/model/document/#parameters-keywords)
- Generated PDFs now contain PDF document IDs
- The PDF creator tool metadata now includes the Typst version

## Web app

- Added version picker to pin a project to an older compiler version (with support for Typst 0.6.0+)
- Fixed desyncs between editor and compiler and improved overall stability
- The app now continues to highlight the document when typing while the document is being compiled

## Command line interface

- Added support for discovering fonts through fontconfig
- Now clears the screen instead of resetting the terminal
- Now automatically picks correct file extension for selected output format
- Now only regenerates images for changed pages when using `typst watch` with PNG or SVG export

## Miscellaneous Improvements

- Added [`version`](/docs/reference/foundations/version/) type and `sys.version` constant specifying the current compiler version. Can be used to gracefully support multiple versions.
- The U+2212 MINUS SIGN is now used when displaying a numeric value, in the [`repr`](/docs/reference/foundations/repr/) of any numeric value and to replace a normal hyphen in text mode when before a digit. This improves, in particular, how negative integer values are displayed in math mode.
- Added support for specifying a default value instead of failing for `remove` function in [array](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-remove) and [dictionary](/docs/reference/foundations/dictionary/#definitions-remove)
- Simplified Page Setup Guide examples
- Switched the documentation from using the word "hashtag" to the word "hash" where appropriate
- Added support for [`array.zip`](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-zip) without any further arguments
- Fixed crash when a plugin tried to read out of bounds memory
- Fixed crashes when handling infinite [lengths](/docs/reference/layout/length/)
- Fixed introspection (mostly bibliography) bugs due to weak page break close to the end of the document

## Development

- Extracted `typst::ide` into separate `typst_ide` crate
- Removed a few remaining `'static` bounds on `&dyn World`
- Removed unnecessary dependency, which reduces the binary size
- Fixed compilation of `typst` by itself (without `typst-library`)
- Fixed warnings with Nix flake when using `lib.getExe`
