# 0.12.0

## Highlights

- Added support for multi-column floating [placement](/docs/reference/layout/place/#parameters-scope) and [figures](/docs/reference/model/figure/#parameters-scope)
- Added support for automatic [line numbering](/docs/reference/model/par/#definitions-line) (often used in academic papers)
- Typst's layout engine is now multithreaded. Typical speedups are 2-3x for larger documents. The multithreading operates on page break boundaries, so explicit page breaks are necessary for it to kick in.
- Paragraph justification was optimized with a new two-pass algorithm. Speedups are larger for shorter paragraphs and go up to 6x.
- Highly reduced PDF file sizes due to better font subsetting (thanks to [@LaurenzV](https://github.com/LaurenzV))
- Emoji are now exported properly in PDF
- Added initial support for PDF/A. For now, only the PDF/A-2b profile is supported, but more is planned for the future.
- Added various options for configuring the CLI's environment (fonts, package paths, etc.)
- Text show rules now match across multiple text elements
- Block-level equations can now optionally break over multiple pages
- Fixed a bug where some fonts would not print correctly on professional printers
- Fixed a long-standing bug which could cause headings to be orphaned at the bottom of the page

## Layout

- Added support for multi-column floating placement and figures via [`place.scope`](/docs/reference/layout/place/#parameters-scope) and [`figure.scope`](/docs/reference/model/figure/#parameters-scope).  Two-column documents should now prefer `set page(columns: 2)` over `show: column.with(2)` (see the [Page Setup Guide](/docs/guides/page-setup/#columns)).
- Added support for automatic [line numbering](/docs/reference/model/par/#definitions-line) (often used in academic papers)
- Added [`par.spacing`](/docs/reference/model/par/#parameters-spacing) property for configuring paragraph spacing. This should now be used instead of `show par: set block(spacing: ..)` **(Breaking change)**
- Block-level elements like lists, grids, and stacks now show themselves as blocks and are thus affected by all block properties (e.g. `stroke`) rather than just `spacing` **(Breaking change)**
- Added [`block.sticky`](/docs/reference/layout/block/#parameters-sticky) property which prevents a page break after a block
- Added [`place.flush`](/docs/reference/layout/place/#definitions-flush) function which forces all floating figures to be placed before any further content
- Added [`skew`](/docs/reference/layout/skew/) function
- Added `auto` option for [`page.header`](/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-header) and [`page.footer`](/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-footer) which results in an automatic header/footer based on the numbering (which was previously inaccessible after a change)
- Added `gap` and `justify` parameters to [`repeat`](/docs/reference/layout/repeat/) function
- Added `width` and `height` parameters to the [`measure`](/docs/reference/layout/measure/) function to define the space in which the content should be measured. Especially useful in combination with [`layout`](/docs/reference/layout/layout/).
- The height of a `block`, `image`, `rect`, `square`, `ellipse`, or `circle` can now be specified in [fractional units](/docs/reference/layout/fraction/)
- The [`scale`](/docs/reference/layout/scale/) function now supports absolute lengths for `x`, `y`, `factor`. This way an element of unknown size can be scaled to a fixed size.
- The values of `block.above` and `block.below` can now be retrieved in context expressions.
- Increased accuracy of conversions between absolute units (pt, mm, cm, in)
- Fixed a bug which could cause headings to be orphaned at the bottom of the page
- Fixed footnotes within breakable blocks appearing on the page where the breakable block ends instead of at the page where the footnote marker is
- Fixed numbering of nested footnotes and footnotes in floats
- Fixed empty pages appearing when a [context](/docs/reference/context/) expression wraps whole pages
- Fixed `set block(spacing: x)` behaving differently from `set block(above: x, below: x)`
- Fixed behavior of [`rotate`](/docs/reference/layout/rotate/) and [`scale`](/docs/reference/layout/scale/) with `reflow: true`
- Fixed interaction of `align(horizon)` and `v(1fr)`
- Fixed various bugs where floating placement would yield overlapping results
- Fixed a bug where widow/orphan prevention would unnecessarily move text into the next column
- Fixed [weak spacing](/docs/reference/layout/h/#parameters-weak) not being trimmed at the start and end of lines in a paragraph (only at the start and end of paragraphs)
- Fixed interaction of weak page break and [`pagebreak.to`](/docs/reference/layout/pagebreak/#parameters-to)
- Fixed compilation output of a single weak page break
- Fixed crash when [padding](/docs/reference/layout/pad/) by `100%`

## Text

- Tuned hyphenation: It is less eager by default and hyphenations close to the edges of words are now discouraged more strongly **(May lead to larger layout reflows)**
- New default font: Libertinus Serif. This is the maintained successor to the old default font Linux Libertine. **(May lead to smaller reflows)**
- Setting the font to an unavailable family will now result in a warning
- Implemented a new smart quote algorithm, fixing various bugs where smart quotes weren't all that smart
- Added [`text.costs`](/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-costs) parameter for tweaking various parameters that affect the choices of the layout engine during text layout

- Added basic i18n for Galician, Catalan, Latin, Icelandic, Hebrew
- Implemented hyphenation duplication for Czech, Croatian, Lower Sorbian, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, and Spanish.
- The [`smallcaps`](/docs/reference/text/smallcaps/) function is now an element function and can thereby be used in show(-set) rules.
- The [`raw.theme`](/docs/reference/text/raw/#parameters-theme) parameter can now be set to `none` to disable highlighting even in the presence of a language tag, and to `auto` to reset to the default

- New font metadata exceptions for Archivo, Kaiti SC, and Kaiti TC
- Updated bundled New Computer Modern fonts to version 6.0

## Math

- Block-level equations can now break over multiple pages if enabled via `show math.equation: set block(breakable: true)`.
- Matrix and vector sizing is now more consistent across different cell contents
- Added [`stretch`](/docs/reference/math/stretch/) function for manually or automatically stretching characters like arrows or parentheses horizontally or vertically
- Improved layout of attachments on parenthesized as well as under- or overlined expressions
- Improved layout of nested attachments resulting from code like `#let a0 = $a_0$; $a0^1$`
- Improved layout of primes close to superscripts

- Typst now makes use of math-specific height-dependent kerning information in some fonts for better attachment layout
- The `floor` and `ceil` functions in math are now callable symbols, such that `$ floor(x) = lr(floor.l x floor.r) $`
- The [`mat.delim`](/docs/reference/math/mat/#parameters-delim), [`vec.delim`](/docs/reference/math/vec/#parameters-delim), and [`cases.delim`](/docs/reference/math/cases/#parameters-delim) parameters now allow any character that is considered a delimiter or "fence" (e.g. |) by Unicode. The `delim: "||"` notation is _not_ supported anymore and should be replaced by `delim: bar.double` **(Minor breaking change)**
- Added [`vec.align`](/docs/reference/math/vec/#parameters-align) and [`mat.align`](/docs/reference/math/mat/#parameters-align) parameters
- Added [`underparen`](/docs/reference/math/underover/#functions-underparen), [`overparen`](/docs/reference/math/underover/#functions-overparen), [`undershell`](/docs/reference/math/underover/#functions-undershell), and [`overshell`](/docs/reference/math/underover/#functions-overshell)
- Added `~` shorthand for `tilde.op` in math mode **(Minor breaking change)**
- Fixed baseline alignment of equation numbers
- Fixed positioning of corner brackets (⌜, ⌝, ⌞, ⌟)

- Fixed resolving of em units in sub- and superscripts
- Fixed bounding box of inline equations when a [text edge](/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-top-edge) is set to `"bounds"`

## Introspection

- Implemented a new system by which Typst tracks where elements end up on the pages. This may lead to subtly different behavior in introspections. **(Breaking change)**
- Fixed various bugs with wrong counter behavior in complex layout situations, through a new, more principled implementation
- Counter updates can now be before the first, in between, and after the last page when isolated by weak page breaks. This allows, for instance, updating a counter before the first page header and background.
- Fixed logical ordering of introspections within footnotes and figures
- Fixed incorrect [`here().position()`](/docs/reference/introspection/here/) when [`place`](/docs/reference/layout/place/) was used in a context expression
- Fixed resolved positions of elements (in particular, headings) whose show rule emits an invisible element (like a state update) before a page break
- Fixed behavior of stepping a counter at a deeper level than its current state has
- Fixed citation formatting not working in table headers and a few other places
- Displaying the footnote counter will now respect the footnote numbering style

## Model

- Document set rules do not need to be at the very start of the document anymore. The only restriction is that they must not occur inside of layout containers.
- The `spacing` property of [lists](/docs/reference/model/list/#parameters-spacing), [enumerations](/docs/reference/model/enum/#parameters-spacing), and [term lists](/docs/reference/model/terms/#parameters-spacing) is now also respected for tight lists
- Tight lists now only attach (with tighter spacing) to preceding paragraphs, not arbitrary blocks
- The [`quote`](/docs/reference/model/quote/) element is now locatable (can be used in queries)
- The bibliography heading now uses `depth` instead of `level` so that its level can still be configured via a show-set rule
- Added support for more [numbering](/docs/reference/model/numbering/) formats: Devanagari, Eastern Arabic, Bengali, and circled numbers
- Added [`hanging-indent`](/docs/reference/model/heading/#parameters-hanging-indent) parameter to heading function to tweak the appearance of multi-line headings and improved default appearance of multi-line headings
- Improved handling of bidirectional text in outline entry
- Fixed document set rules being ignored in an otherwise empty document
- Fixed document set rules not being usable in context expressions
- Fixed bad interaction between `set document` and `set page`
- Fixed `show figure: set align(..)`. Since the default figure alignment is now a show-set rule, it is not revoked by `show figure: it => it.body` anymore. **(Minor breaking change)**
- Fixed numbering of footnote references
- Fixed spacing after bibliography heading

## Bibliography

- The Hayagriva YAML `publisher` field can now accept a dictionary with a `location` key. The top-level `location` key is now primarily intended for event and item locations.

## Visualization

- Added `fill-rule` parameter to [`path`](/docs/reference/visualize/path/#parameters-fill-rule) and [`polygon`](/docs/reference/visualize/polygon/#parameters-fill-rule) functions
- Fixed color mixing and gradients for [Luma colors](/docs/reference/visualize/color/#definitions-luma)
- Fixed conversion from Luma to CMYK colors
- Fixed offset gradient strokes in PNG export
- Fixed unintended cropping of some SVGs
- SVGs with foreign objects now produce a warning as they will likely not render correctly in Typst

## Syntax

- Added support for nested imports like `import "file.typ": module.item`
- Added support for parenthesized imports like `import "file.typ": (a, b, c)`. With those, the import list can break over multiple lines.
- Fixed edge case in parsing of reference syntax
- Fixed edge case in parsing of heading, list, enum, and term markers immediately followed by comments
- Fixed rare crash in parsing of parenthesized expressions

## Scripting

- Added new fixed-point [`decimal`](/docs/reference/foundations/decimal/) number type for highly precise arithmetic on numbers in base 10, as needed for finance
- Added `std` module for accessing standard library definitions even when a variable with the same name shadows/overwrites it
- Added [`array.to-dict`](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-to-dict), [`array.reduce`](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-reduce), [`array.windows`](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-windows) methods
- Added `exact` argument to [`array.zip`](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-zip)
- Added [`arguments.at`](/docs/reference/foundations/arguments/#definitions-at) method

- Added proper support for negative values of the `digits` parameter of [`calc.round`](/docs/reference/foundations/calc/#functions-round) (the behaviour existed before but was subtly broken)
- Conversions from [`int`](/docs/reference/foundations/int/) to [`float`](/docs/reference/foundations/float/) will now error instead of saturating if the float is too large **(Minor breaking change)**
- Added `float.nan` and `float.inf`, removed `calc.nan` **(Minor breaking change)**
- Certain symbols are now generally callable like functions and not only specifically in math. Examples are accents or [`floor`](/docs/reference/math/lr/#functions-floor) and [`ceil`](/docs/reference/math/lr/#functions-ceil).
- Improved [`repr`](/docs/reference/foundations/repr/) of relative values, sequences, infinities, NaN, `type(none)` and `type(auto)`
- Fixed crash on whole packages (rather than just files) cyclically importing each other
- Fixed return type of [`calc.round`](/docs/reference/foundations/calc/#functions-round) on integers when a non-zero value is provided for `digits`

## Styling

- Text show rules now match across multiple text elements
- The string `"` in a text show rule now matches smart quotes
- Fixed a long-standing styling bug where the header and footer would incorrectly inherit styles from a lone element on the page (e.g. a heading)
- Fixed `set page` not working directly after a counter/state update
- Page fields configured via an explicit `page(..)[..]` call can now be properly retrieved in context expressions

## Export

- Highly reduced PDF file sizes due to better font subsetting
- Emoji are now exported properly in PDF
- Added initial support for PDF/A. For now, only the standard PDF/A-2b is supported, but more is planned for the future. Enabled via `--pdf-standard a-2b` in the CLI and via the UI in File \> Export as \> PDF in the web app.
- Setting [`page.fill`](/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-fill) to `none` will now lead to transparent pages instead of white ones in PNG and SVG. The new default of `auto` means transparent for PDF and white for PNG and SVG.
- Improved text copy-paste from PDF in complex scenarios
- Exported SVGs now contain the `data-typst-label` attribute on groups resulting from labelled [boxes](/docs/reference/layout/box/) and [blocks](/docs/reference/layout/block/)
- Fixed a bug where some fonts would not print correctly on professional printers
- Fixed a bug where transparency could leak from one PDF object to another
- Fixed a bug with CMYK gradients in PDF
- Fixed various bugs with export of Oklab gradients in PDF
- Fixed crashes related to rendering of non-outline glyphs
- Two small fixes for PDF standard conformance

## Performance

- Typst's layout engine is now multithreaded. Typical speedups are 2-3x for larger documents. The multithreading operates on page break boundaries, so explicit page breaks are necessary for it to kick in.
- Paragraph justification was optimized with a new two-pass algorithm. Speedups are larger for shorter paragraphs and range from 1-6x.

## Command Line Interface

- Added `--pages` option to select specific page ranges to export
- Added `--package-path` and `--package-cache-path` as well as `TYPST_PACKAGE_PATH` and `TYPST_PACKAGE_CACHE_PATH` environment variables for configuring where packages are loaded from and cached in, respectively
- Added `--ignore-system-fonts` flag to disable system fonts fully for better reproducibility
- Added `--make-deps` argument for outputting the dependencies of the current compilation as a Makefile
- Added `--pretty` option to `typst query`, with the default now being to minify (only applies to JSON format)
- Added `--backup-path` to `typst update` to configure where the previous version is backed up
- Added useful links to help output
- The CLI will now greet users who invoke just `typst` for the first time
- The document can now be written to stdout by passing `-` as the output filename (for PDF or single-page image export)
- Typst will now emit a proper error message instead of failing silently when the certificate specified by `--cert` or `TYPST_CERT` could not be loaded
- The CLI now respects the `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` environment variable for better reproducibility
- When exporting multiple images, you can now use `t` (total pages), `p` (current page), and `0p` (zero-padded current page, same as current `n`) in the output path
- The input and output paths now allow non-UTF-8 values
- Times are now formatted more consistently across the CLI
- Fixed a bug related to the `--open` flag
- Fixed path completions for `typst` not working in zsh
