# 0.11.0

## Tables

- Tables are now _much_ more flexible, read the new [Table Guide](/docs/guides/tables/) to get started
- Added [`table.cell`](/docs/reference/model/table/#definitions-cell) element for per-cell configuration
- Cells can now span multiple [columns](/docs/reference/model/table/#definitions-cell-colspan) or [rows](/docs/reference/model/table/#definitions-cell-rowspan)
- The [stroke](/docs/reference/model/table/#definitions-cell-stroke) of individual cells can now be customized
- The [`align`](/docs/reference/model/table/#parameters-align) and [`inset`](/docs/reference/model/table/#parameters-inset) arguments of the table function now also take `(x, y) => ..` functions
- Added [`table.hline`](/docs/reference/model/table/#definitions-hline) and [`table.vline`](/docs/reference/model/table/#definitions-vline) for convenient line customization
- Added [`table.header`](/docs/reference/model/table/#definitions-header) element for table headers that repeat on every page
- Added [`table.footer`](/docs/reference/model/table/#definitions-footer) element for table footers that repeat on every page
- All the new table functionality is also available for [grids](/docs/reference/layout/grid/)
- Fixed gutter-related bugs

_Thanks to @PgBiel for his work on tables!_

## Templates

- You can now use template packages to get started with new projects. Click _Start from template_ on the web app's dashboard and choose your preferred template or run the `typst init <template>` command in the CLI. You can [browse the available templates here](https://typst.app/universe/search/?kind=templates).
- Switching templates after the fact has become easier. You can just import a styling function from a different template package.
- Package authors can now submit their own templates to the [package repository](https://github.com/typst/packages). Share a template for a paper, your institution, or an original work to help the community get a head start on their projects.
- Templates and packages are now organized by category and discipline. Filter packages by either taxonomy in the _Start from template_ wizard. If you are a package author, take a look at the new documentation for [categories](https://github.com/typst/packages/blob/main/docs/CATEGORIES.md) and [disciplines](https://github.com/typst/packages/blob/main/docs/DISCIPLINES.md).

## Context

- Added _context expressions:_ Read the chapter on [context](/docs/reference/context/) to get started
- With context, you can access settable properties, e.g. `context text.lang` to access the language set via `set text(lang: "..")`
- The following existing functions have been made contextual: [`query`](/docs/reference/introspection/query/), [`locate`](/docs/reference/introspection/locate/), [`measure`](/docs/reference/layout/measure/), [`counter.display`](/docs/reference/introspection/counter/#definitions-display), [`counter.at`](/docs/reference/introspection/counter/#definitions-at), [`counter.final`](/docs/reference/introspection/counter/#definitions-final), [`state.at`](/docs/reference/introspection/state/#definitions-at), and [`state.final`](/docs/reference/introspection/state/#definitions-final)
- Added contextual methods [`counter.get`](/docs/reference/introspection/counter/#definitions-get) and [`state.get`](/docs/reference/introspection/state/#definitions-get) to retrieve the value of a counter or state in the current context
- Added contextual function [`here`](/docs/reference/introspection/here/) to retrieve the [location](/docs/reference/introspection/location/) of the current context
- The [`locate`](/docs/reference/introspection/locate/) function now returns the location of a selector's unique match. Its old behavior has been replaced by context expressions and only remains temporarily available for compatibility.
- The [`counter.at`](/docs/reference/introspection/counter/#definitions-at) and [`state.at`](/docs/reference/introspection/state/#definitions-at) methods are now more flexible: They directly accept any kind of [locatable](/docs/reference/introspection/location/#locatable) selector with a unique match (e.g. a label) instead of just locations
- When context is available, [`counter.display`](/docs/reference/introspection/counter/#definitions-display) now directly returns the result of applying the numbering instead of yielding opaque content. It should not be used anymore without context. (Deprecation planned)
- The `state.display` function should not be used anymore, use [`state.get`](/docs/reference/introspection/state/#definitions-get) instead (Deprecation planned)
- The `location` argument of [`query`](/docs/reference/introspection/query/), [`counter.final`](/docs/reference/introspection/counter/#definitions-final), and [`state.final`](/docs/reference/introspection/state/#definitions-final) should not be used anymore (Deprecation planned)
- The `styles` argument of the `measure` function should not be used anymore (Deprecation planned)
- The `style` function should not be used anymore, use context instead (Deprecation planned)
- The correct context is now also provided in various other places where it is available, e.g. in show rules, layout callbacks, and numbering functions in the outline

## Styling

- Fixed priority of multiple [show-set rules](/docs/reference/styling/#show-rules): They now apply in the same order as normal set rules would
- Show-set rules on the same element (e.g. `show heading.where(level: 1): set heading(numbering: "1.")`) now work properly
- Setting properties on an element within a transformational show rule (e.g. `show heading: it => \{ set heading(..); it \}`) is **not** supported anymore (previously it also only worked sometimes); use show-set rules instead **(Breaking change)**
- Text show rules that match their own output now work properly (e.g. `show "cmd": `cmd``)
- The elements passed to show rules and returned by queries now contain all fields of their respective element functions rather than just specific ones
- All settable properties can now be used in [where](/docs/reference/foundations/function/#definitions-where) selectors
- [And](/docs/reference/foundations/selector/#definitions-and) and [or](/docs/reference/foundations/selector/#definitions-or) selectors can now be used with show rules
- Errors within show rules and context expressions are now ignored in all but the last introspection iteration, in line with the behavior of the old [`locate`](/docs/reference/introspection/locate/)
- Fixed a bug where document set rules were allowed after content

## Layout

- Added `reflow` argument to [`rotate`](/docs/reference/layout/rotate/) and [`scale`](/docs/reference/layout/scale/) which lets them affect the layout
- Fixed a bug where [floating placement](/docs/reference/layout/place/#parameters-float) or [floating figures](/docs/reference/model/figure/#parameters-placement) could end up out of order
- Fixed overlap of text and figure for full-page floating figures
- Fixed various cases where the [`hide`](/docs/reference/layout/hide/) function didn't hide its contents properly
- Fixed usage of [`h`](/docs/reference/layout/h/) and [`v`](/docs/reference/layout/v/) in [stacks](/docs/reference/layout/stack/)
- Invisible content like a counter update will no longer force a visible block for just itself
- Fixed a bug with horizontal spacing followed by invisible content (like a counter update) directly at the start of a paragraph

## Text

- Added basic i18n for Serbian and Catalan

## Model

- Added [`depth`](/docs/reference/model/heading/#parameters-depth) and [`offset`](/docs/reference/model/heading/#parameters-offset) arguments to heading to increase or decrease the heading level for a bunch of content; the heading syntax now sets `depth` rather than `level` **(Breaking change)**
- List [markers](/docs/reference/model/list/#parameters-marker) now cycle by default
- The [`quote`](/docs/reference/model/quote/) function now more robustly selects the correct quotes based on language and nesting
- Fixed indent bugs related to the default show rule of [terms](/docs/reference/model/terms/)

- Math mode is not affected by [`strong`](/docs/reference/model/strong/) and [`emph`](/docs/reference/model/emph/) anymore

## Development

- Added `--vendor-openssl` to CLI to configure whether to link OpenSSL statically instead of dynamically (not applicable to Windows and Apple platforms)
- Removed old tracing (and its verbosity) flag from the CLI
