## PDF export

PDF export was fully rewritten to use the new [`krilla`](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla) library, fixing various bugs and enabling many improvements. Known fixes are listed below, but there will likely be other changes in how the output behaves. If you spot any regressions, please [report them on GitHub](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues). _(Thanks to @LaurenzV for creating krilla!)_ [#5420](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/5420)

- Typst now produces _accessible_ PDFs out of the box. Such documents are suitable for consumption in a wide range of circumstances. That not only includes consumption by people with permanent or temporary disabilities, but also by those with different devices or preferences. 
  - Typst PDFs are now _tagged_ by default. _Tags_ are rich metadata that PDF viewers can use to make the document consumable in other ways than visually (e.g., through a screen reader).
  - In addition, Typst can now emit documents conforming to the PDF/UA-1 standard. (PDF/UA-2 is not yet supported, but planned.)
  - There is an increasing amount of existing and upcoming legislation requiring documents to be accessible, for instance, the European Accessibility Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
  - For more details on all of this, read the new [Accessibility Guide](/docs/guides/accessibility/).
- Typst now supports all PDF/A standards: PDF/A-1b, PDF/A-1a, PDF/A-2b, PDF/A-2u, PDF/A-2a, PDF/A-3b, PDF/A-3u, PDF/A-3a, PDF/A-4, PDF/A-4f, and PDF/A-4e. See the [expanded PDF/A documentation](/docs/reference/pdf/#pdf-a) for guidance on how to select a suitable standard. [#5420](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/5420) [#7038](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7038)
- Typst now supports the PDF versions 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, and 2.0 in addition to PDF 1.7. See the [relevant section of the PDF documentation](/docs/reference/pdf/#pdf-versions) for details. [#5420](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/5420)
- Added [`pdf.artifact`](/docs/reference/pdf/artifact/) function for marking content as not semantically meaningful [#6619](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6619)
- Added experimental [`pdf.header-cell`](/docs/reference/pdf/header-cell/), [`pdf.data-cell`](/docs/reference/pdf/data-cell/), and [`pdf.table-summary`](/docs/reference/pdf/table-summary/) functions for enhancing accessibility of documents with complex tables. These functions are guarded by the `a11y-extras` feature. They do not have a final interface and will be removed in the future, either through integration into table functions or through full removal. [#6619](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6619)
- PDF heading bookmarks now contain the heading's numbering [#6622](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6622)
- [Attachments](/docs/reference/pdf/attach/) 
  - Renamed `pdf.embed` to [`pdf.attach`](/docs/reference/pdf/attach/) (the old name will remain as a deprecated alias until Typst 0.15) [#6705](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6705)
  - The [`mime`](/docs/reference/pdf/attach/#parameters-mime-type) property of `pdf.attach` is now checked for syntactical correctness **(Minor breaking change)**
  - Fixed parsing of the [`data`](/docs/reference/pdf/attach/#parameters-data) argument of `pdf.attach` [#6435](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6435)
  - Attachments now smartly determine whether they should be compressed [#6256](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6256)
- Text extraction (i.e. copy paste) 
  - Now works correctly even when multiple different characters result in the same glyph [#5420](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/5420)
  - Spaces between words at which a natural line break occurred are now correctly retained for text extraction [#6866](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6866)
  - Fixed mapping of hyphenation artifacts to Unicode text [#6799](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6799)

- Fixed encoding of `<pre>` and `<textarea>` elements that start with a newline [#6487](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6487) [#6497](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6497)
- Fixed encoding of [raw text elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#raw-text-elements) [#6487](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6487) [#6720](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6720)

## Layout

- Added opt-in support for character-level justification in addition to word-level justification, configured via the new [`par.justification-limits`](/docs/reference/model/par/#parameters-justification-limits) property.

## Symbols

- Added many new symbols and variants; many more than could be listed here. View [the dedicated changelog](https://github.com/typst/codex/blob/v0.2.0/CHANGELOG.md#version-020-october-7-2025) for a full listing.
- Code points that have a symbol and emoji presentation now have the correct variation selector attached depending on whether they appear in `sym` or `emoji`. That said, they still don't render consistently in Typst due to how font fallback works. [typst/codex#114](https://github.com/typst/codex/issues/114)
- The [`symbol`](/docs/reference/foundations/symbol/) function can now be used to create symbols that comprise not just one character, but one full grapheme cluster [#6489](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6489)

## Deprecations

- The name `pdf.embed` in favor of the new name [`pdf.attach`](/docs/reference/pdf/attach/) [#6705](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6705)
- The `"chicago-fullnotes"` bibliography style in favor of `"chicago-notes"` [#6920](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6920)

## Removals

- Removed compatibility behavior of type/str comparisons (e.g. `int == "integer"`), which was temporarily introduced in Typst 0.8 and deprecated in Typst 0.13 **(Breaking change)**

## Development

- The `Default` impl for `Library` had to be removed for crate splitting and trait coherence reasons, but you can get a drop-in replacement via `use typst::LibraryExt` [#6576](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6576)
- The `PdfOptions` struct has a new `tagged` field, which defaults to `true` [#6619](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/6619) [#7046](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7046)
